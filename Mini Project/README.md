# Mini Project

This folder contains code used for the SEED Lab "Mini Project".

The programs of importance are `pi_program.py`, `pi_camera.py`, and `arduino_program`.

`pi_program.py` depends on `pi_camera.py` to run, and should be run on the Raspberry Pi.

`arduino_program` contains a single `arduino_program.ino`, and should be uploaded to the Arduino.
