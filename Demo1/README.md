This is the read me for the Demo 1. Team 3 SEEDLab 2023

In this folder, there is code for the arduino which has PI control to do the rotation of the robot, and the linear movement of the robot.
There is also code for the Pi which finds a marker and calculates the angle to that marker.

These subsystems are not integrated together yet, and have to be run seperatly at the moment.
